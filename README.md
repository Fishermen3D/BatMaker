# BatMaker
this is a VERY specific tool to create a .bat file from an xml file

This is a small piece of code I made for a school project. 

This creates a batch script based on the xml file given.

I cannot imagine anyone ever using this.
I am only oploading this in case if once in a blue moon I need this again.
